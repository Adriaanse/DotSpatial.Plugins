# DotSpatial.Plugins

Forked from FObermaier/DotSpatial.Plugins

Personal copy to update BrutileLayer to DotSpatial 1.9 release (NuGet) and Dutch PDOK tile service

Observation: BrutileLayer works just fine with DotSpatial release version 1.9 !

## Current plugins

#### DotSpatial.Plugins.BruTileLayer 
A plugin that brings BruTile functionality to DotSpatial. The plugin has UI components to configure the BruTile layers.

#### DotSpatial.Plugins.SharpMapLayer
This is a proof of concept and disabled by default.

## Note:
**SharpMapLayer** and **BruTileLayer** cannot be run at the same time as they both rely on different versions of BruTile.
